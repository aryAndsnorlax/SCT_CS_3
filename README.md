This project is a simple Password Strength Checker written in Python. It helps users create secure passwords by validating them against common security criteria such as minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program gives clear feedback on which conditions are met and continues to prompt until a strong password is entered. Itâ€™s lightweight, beginner-friendly, and useful for practicing password security concepts.
